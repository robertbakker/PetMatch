# Pet Match

Because there are a lot of animals in the animal shelter I have created an app to help animals get a new owner. Within the app, potential new pet owners can view pictures of the animals in the shelters. Each animal has it’s own profile with a picture.

The user sees an animal and can swipe to the right to ‘like’ the animal and swipe to the left if the user is not interested.

When the user has liked the animal, it goes in to his favorite list and the user could possibly contact the animal shelter to pick up his new pet!
